# Ex 07 - String Maths?

# Yes, math operators can be done with Strings
# When we "add" a string, it's a process called "concatenate"
concat_string_0 = "Please " + "I want some more"
#TODO go ahead and print conca_string_0 and check out the output

# concatentation seems an odd thing to include
# but this is used a lot in some form or another

# you can also multiply strings
multiply_string_0 = "Three" * 3
#TODO print multiply_string_0 to console

# cool, but it looks ugly.
#TODO modify the value of multiply_string_1 so a space is between the threes
# make sure you print to console
multiply_string_1 = "Three" * 3

# Better, right? the space at the beginning/end - depending on how you solved it -
# isn't the prettiest either. Bonus time, try and figure out how to get rid of it.
# Googling is allowed, I don't expect you to know this yet

#TODO figure out how to get rid of space at the beginning/end of multiply_string_1
# make sure you print to console

# That's all the 'math' operations one can do on strings
# with the math operators (+,-,*,/)
