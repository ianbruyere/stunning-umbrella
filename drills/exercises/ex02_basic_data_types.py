# Data Types are fancy names with special assignment conditions
# The high level view is that Data Types matter so the computer
# know what operations are permissible These rules help the programmer too. 
# More on this later, lets dive in.

#NOTE We aren't going into ALL of the datatypes here. 
# I plan on mentioning the most prescient.

# 1. String, denoted in Python as str.
# a string is desginated by any symbol - a,b,c,1,2,!,#,% etc. - surrounded by 
# a double quote(") or a single-quote(').
# But they must match on either end. 
# Below are some valid combinations:
string_1 = "This is a string"
string_2 = 'This is ALSO a string'
string_3 = "This 'will' work"
#TODO Fix string_4 to have properly matched quotes
string_4 = "Please' correct" this
 

# 2. Integer, denoted as int in Python
# Integers are numbers with no decimal places.
# They can be negative, positive, or 0.
# Assigning an Integer is as easy as below.
integer_1 = 8
integer_2 = 129999
integer_3 = 149472068585858
#TODO make not_integer an integer(keep the variable name the same PLEASE) 
not_integer = 4.0 # this is another numeric type: a float, beyond scope
#TODO make not_integer_2 a integer as well please, don't change the variable name though
not_integer_2 = '140' # what type is this? 

# 3. Boolean, denoted as bool in Python
# despite the weird name there are only TWO
# values that fall under boolean: True and False
# And they work exactly how you'd expect.
# Change the below so they match. And take care of your spelling:
# the case of the first letter matters!

#TODO change the variable false to have a value of False
false = True
#TODO change the variable true to have a value of True
true = False
#TODO make false_2 a bool type, the value is up to you
false_2 = 'True'
#TODO make true_2 a bool type, value is up to you
true_2 = 'False'
