# Ex 04 Printing Objects

# Don't Worry, print can print variables too
call_out = "HOOTY-HOO"
print(call_out)

# what's an Argument? "print" falls into a broader category called "functions" 
# "functions" are passed things called "arguments"
# anything that's between the parantheses of print is called an "argument"


# it knows what you want, you can even print multiple types, 
# as long as your arguments are separated by commas
print("We are the", 3,"Stooges", True, call_out)

# all of the above will be printed on one line, with spaces between each argument
# In the above example the following are arguments:
# "We are the" is an argument. 3 is an argument, "Stooges" is one, True, and call_out.
# Let's get you printing.

#TODO print a boolean to console


#TODO make a variable - name it whatever you want - and assign a string to it with the value
# of "beans beans". Than print that variable.
