# Ex 06 - More Math Stuff
# Up to this point we've only been dealing with integers
# what do you suppose the result of this operation is?
not_round_0 = 3 / 2
#TODO print what not_round_1 evalutaes to 

# How about this one?
not_round_1 = 3 / 4
#TODO print what not_round_2 evaluates to

# A hand calculator can handle such operations so can Python
# Operations where the answer is not an integer 
# give us a new data type called "floats". 
# Before we get into any operations lets learn how to assign a float. 
# It's simple:
float_0 = 1.0
integer_0 = 1

# Note the difference between how we specify a float vs. an integer
# you are not limited to one decimal place either
float_1 = 7.86793 # this is valid too

# But lets stick to one decimal place
# All the same operators you did in Ex 04 still apply to floats
#TODO print the result of 3.5 + 45.7 - 36.8 / 19

# there are a WHOLE lot of caveats with float that is beyond
# the scope of anything we will be doing in any of the exercies
# if we really want our integers to stay integers check out the following:
float_3 = 3 / 2 # evaluates to 1.5
int_1 = 3 // 2 # evaluates to 1

# the // operator rounds DOWN the result to the nearest integer
#TODO print the result of 17 // 2
