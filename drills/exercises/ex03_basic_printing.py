# Ex 03 Basic Printing - the part where we can see a result
# up til now you've been changing assignment.
# But your variables haven't been put to use. 
# Let's change that with the print command. 
# And tbh printing is probably going to be boring to you.
# it's value lies down the road in letting you SEE
# what the computer sees allowing you to troubleshoot complex programs later
# get used to printing, it is the hammer in your toolbox.

# printing is easy. 
# Following is a complete print statement

print()

# simple right?
# if you were to run this program right now, and only up to the line above
# it would simply spit out a blank line.
# so lets make it do more by putting something BETWEEN the parantheses

print("This string will be printed")
print(3)
print(True)

# All of those above statements will be printed now, each on their own line
# notice how print doesn't care about the data type of the thing it's printing
# Enough talk; lets get you printing

#TODO print a string to console

#TODO print an integer to console

#TODO print a bool to console
